# pyCA Configuration
##

# Notice: Most properties do have sensible defaults. Things that should be
# changed are those properties that are not commented out in this file.


[agent]

# Name of the capture agent
# Type: string
# Default: pyca
name             = 'pyca'

# How often (in seconds) should the capture agent try to get an updated
# schedule from the core.
# Type: integer
# Default: 60
#update_frequency = 60

# For how many days in advance shall the capture agent get the schedule. A
# smaller value will be faster and less memory consuming. Setting this to 0
# will make pyCA request all scheduled events.
# Type: integer
# Default: 14
#cal_lookahead    = 14

# In backup mode, the pyCA will not register itself or ingest anything to the
# core. It is useful if you want pyCA act as backup to another capture agent.
# To get the events for another agent, also set the name of the agent to the
# one that should be backed up.
# Type: boolean
# Default: False
#backup_mode      = False

# Location of the database file to cache scheduled events in and keep a
# history of recordings. This can be any database supported by SQLAlchemy.
# Type: String
# Default: sqlite:///pyca.db
#database = sqlite:///pyca.db


[capture]

# Base directory to store recordings in. For each recording a subdirectory
# will be created.
# Type: string
# Default: ./recordings
directory        = './recordings'

# Command to use for capturing. This may also be a script file. The only
# requirement is that the command terminates itself in time.
#
# Possible string substitutions you can use are:
#   {{time}}        Time to capture in seconds
#   {{dir}}         Directory to put recordings in
#   {{name}}        Autogenerated name of the recording.
#   {{previewdir}}  Directory to put preview images in
#
# Examples:
#
# Record pulseaudio source using FFmpeg:
#   ffmpeg -f pulse -i default -t %(time)s -c:a flac -ac 1 {{dir}}/{{name}}.flac
#
# Record video stream on a Reaspberry Pi using the camera module:
#   raspivid -n -t %(time)s000 -b 6000000 -fps 30 -o {{dir}}/{{name}}.h264
#
# Record audio using arecord (alsa recorder):
#   arecord -c 2 -d {{time}} -r 44100 -f S16_LE -D hw:0 {{dir}}/{{name}}.wav
#
# Run custom shell script:
#   /opt/rec.sh "{{dir}}" {{name}} {{time}}
#
# For more examples, have a look at the pyCA wiki.
#
# Type: string
# Default: ffmpeg -nostats -re -f lavfi -r 25 -i testsrc -t {{time}} {{dir}}/{{name}}.webm'

# be as confidence monitoring in the web ui.
# Type: String
# Default: ./recordings
#preview_dir      = './recordings'

# List of preview images to be included in the web ui.
# Type: list of strings (write as '...', '...')
# Default:
#preview          =

# Time in seconds after an events end when a SIGTERM is sent to the capture
# process to shut it down in case it does not do that by itself. Setting this
# to -1 will disable the signal.
# Type: Integer
# Default: -1 (disabled)
#sigterm_time     = -1

# Time in seconds after an events end when a SIGKILL is sent to the capture
# process to ensure it terminates and does not block further recordings. Note
# that setting this lower than `sigterm_time` will set this to `sigterm_time`.
# Setting this to -1 will disable the signal.
# Type: Integer
# Default: 120
#sigkill_time     = 120

# An additional exit code to 0 indicating that the capture process has
# been completed successfully.

# Type: string
# Default: http://localhost:5000
#url              = 'http://localhost:5000'
